# My Experience: Tata Group GenAI Job Simulation

Welcome to my project repository! This documents my work during the GenAI Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation with Tata Insights and Quants (Tata iQ).

Instead of just following a tutorial, I stepped into the shoes of an AI Transformation Consultant. My role was to help a client, Geldium Finance, solve a critical business problem: identifying risky customers before they default on credit card payments.

# 📖 The Backstory

The Client: Geldium Finance

The Issue: They were seeing a spike in "delinquency" (people missing payments). They had the data, but they didn't know how to use it to stop the bleeding.

My Goal: I needed to dig into their data, figure out who was missing payments, and then design an AI-driven strategy to fix the collection process without being intrusive.

# Tasks 1
In this task, you will conduct an EDA on Geldium’s dataset to help Tata iQ’s analytics team and Geldium’s decision-makers understand the current state of their data. Your analysis will shape how the company refines its delinquency risk model and improves its intervention strategies.

# Tassk 2
Now that you’ve explored Geldium’s dataset and conducted EDA, it’s time to take the next step: outline a predictive modeling approach to forecast which customers are most at risk of delinquency.

Your goal is to use GenAI tools (like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or DeepSeek) to help scaffold a predictive model concept, select an appropriate modeling approach, and plan how you would evaluate its performance. 

# Task 3
Your job is to translate your predictive findings into a clear, stakeholder-ready report for Geldium’s Head of Collections. This report will be used to inform the team’s next steps and shape how they apply AI insights in their decision-making.

# Task 4
In this task, you’ll create a PowerPoint that outlines your proposed AI-powered collections system. This isn’t a technical system architecture — it’s a high-level strategy describing:

1. How the system would work
2. What ethical and regulatory guardrails it needs
3. How its success would be measured


# 🛠️ What I Actually Did

This simulation wasn't just about writing code; it was about solving problems. Here is the breakdown of my four-stage process:

1. Data Detective Work (EDA)

Before building any models, I had to understand what was going on inside the dataset. I spent time cleaning the data and running an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

What I found: There was a clear pattern. Customers who had been employed for less than two years and had high credit utilization (using >80% of their limit) were significantly more likely to miss payments.

2. Building the Prediction Model

Instead of manually coding a complex machine learning model from scratch, I proposed a No-Code Predictive Framework.

The Approach: I used Generative AI to help write the logic for a decision tree. This allowed me to quickly categorize customers into "High," "Medium," and "Low" risk groups based on the indicators I found in step one. It showed how GenAI can speed up the technical heavy lifting.

3. Translating Code to Business Strategy

Data is useless if the CEO doesn't understand it. I took my technical findings and turned them into a clear, jargon-free presentation for senior leadership.

The Pitch: I explained that by targeting the specific risk factors I found, we could predict—and potentially prevent—about 30-40% of future delinquencies just by intervening earlier.

4. Designing the AI Agent

The final piece was the solution. I designed an AI-Driven Collections Strategy.

How it works: Instead of overwhelmed call center agents calling everyone, an AI "agent" handles the initial outreach for low-risk late payers. It creates a smoother, less aggressive experience for customers while freeing up human staff to handle the complicated, high-risk cases.

# 💡 Key Takeaways

Efficiency is Key: Using GenAI to generate the modeling logic cut down my manual work time by nearly 60%.

Ethics Matter: A big part of my strategy was "Human-in-the-Loop." AI is great for efficiency, but I made sure the system had guardrails so it wouldn't harass vulnerable customers.

The "Why" over the "How": The most valuable part of this project wasn't the code, but realizing that late payments are often a symptom of specific life circumstances (like short job tenure) that we can detect early.

# 💻 Tech Stack

Python: My go-to for data crunching (Pandas, NumPy).

Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for the charts.

GenAI Tools: Used for synthesizing the logic and drafting the predictive framework.
